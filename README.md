Garry's Mod Lua Rollercoasters
==============================

Lua rollercoaster addon for Garry's Mod adds the ability create nodes to create a track. The curves of the track are using the catmull-rom spline algorithm.


#### Features ####
* Coaster node creation tool
* Custom models made by the world acclaimed artist Sunabouzu
* Colorable supports and track
* Saving/Loading of tracks, as well as the ability upload to server
* Change the roll of the track
* Realtime preview of generated mesh. Several mesh generation types
* Realistic cart physics - uses friction and energy conservation concepts to calculate speed.
* Hopefully more eventually

#### Perfomance Settings ####
Although coasters are a relatively low perfomance hit when rendering, some things in excess can get a little slow.
* coaster_supports 1/0 to toggle the drawing of support beams
* coaster_previews 1/0 to toggle the drawing of track previews
* coaster_motionblur 1/0 to toggle the drawing of motion blur.
