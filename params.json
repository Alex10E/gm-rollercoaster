The curves of the track are using the catmull-rom spline algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Features ####\r\n* Fully physical rollercoaster trains with multiple carts per train.\r\n* Rollecoaster SuperTool, combining all the functions needed for coaster creation into one tool.\r\n* Colorable supports and tracks.\r\n* Saving/Loading of tracks, as well as the ability upload to server\r\n* Change the roll of the track for deep turns and crazy barrel rolls.\r\n* Realtime preview of generated mesh. Several mesh generation types and system for creating more.\r\n* Realistic cart physics - uses newton's theories of physics to accurately calculate speed and friction.\r\n* Carts that fly off the track have a chance of hopping back on another track.\r\n* Generated mesh has per-vertex lighting, instead of lighting based around a single point.\r\n\r\n#### Fine-tuning ####\r\nServerside/admin commands and convars.\r\n* coaster_maxcarts (default: 16) The maximum number of *carts* per player that they can spawn.\r\n* coaster_maxnodes (default: 70) The maximum number of *nodes* per player that they can spawn.\r\n* coaster_cart_explosive_damage 1/0 Toggle whether the cart should explode in a massive fireball.\r\n* coaster_downloadtoclient 1/0 Toggle whether to have clients download resources (requires a changelevel to take effect)\r\n\r\nAll of the following settings can be changed in the 'Settings' tab of the SuperTool.\r\n* coaster_supports 1/0 Toggle the drawing of support beams\r\n* coaster_previews 1/0 Toggle the drawing of track previews\r\n* coaster_motionblur 1/0 Toggle the drawing of motion blur.\r\n* coaster_maxwheels (default: 15 ) The maximum number of wheels (breaks, speedups) to be drawing per segment.\r\n* coaster_resolution (default: 15) The 'resolution' of the catmull rom spline for previewed and generated track mesh. Lower = faster generation/better performance.\r\n\r\n#### Installation ####\r\nInstallation is relatively simple. Just extract the Rollercoasters folder into your garrysmod/garrysmod/addons folder.\r\n\r\n#### More information ####\r\n* See current status on rollercoasters via the Trello page [located here](https://trello.com/board/rollercoaster/4fd3f7084971ae066211c8ad)\r\n* [Facepunch Thread](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1200443)\r\n* [Foohy.net](http://foohy.net/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
